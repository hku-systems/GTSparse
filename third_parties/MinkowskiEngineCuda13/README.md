## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install **MinkowskiEngine** with CUDA 13.0 support.

### 1. Create and activate a new Conda environment
```bash
conda create -n mink-cu13 python=3.10
conda activate mink-cu13
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Install OpenBLAS
conda install openblas-devel -c anaconda

# Install the latest version of PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision

# (Recommended) Install the CUDA toolkit
conda install nvidia/label/cuda-{version}::cuda-toolkit
```

### 3. Clone and install MinkowskiEngine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzharSindhi/MinkowskiEngineCuda13.git
cd MinkowskiEngineCuda13

# Set CUDA home path and install
export CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX
python setup.py install --blas=openblas
```

---

### Notes

* Ensure that your GPU drivers are compatible with **CUDA 13.0**.
* The `--blas=openblas` flag is used to build with OpenBLAS support for optimal performance.
* For troubleshooting or performance tuning, refer to the official [MinkowskiEngine documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine).

## References

This repository is adapted from [CiSong10/MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/CiSong10/MinkowskiEngine), which was modified for **CUDA 12.8**. However, that version did not function correctly in my setup, likely due to the need for root permissions to install OpenBLAS (e.g., using `sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libopenblas-dev`). Additionally, issues persisted with **nvtx3**, even after following the recommended installation steps.

This repository provides an updated configuration intended to resolve both of these issues.
